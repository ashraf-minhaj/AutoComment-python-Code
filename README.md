# AutoComment-python-Code
A python code to post comments automatically. It's made for my friend to annoy him using facebook Comment. 

Things must need:
1. A computer with python3 installed
2. pyautgui library installed (pip install pyautogui)

Point the cursor at text box or comment box and the robotic system will automatically type, and post text for 5001 times. If you change the number this can go to infinity too.

# Don't get blocked for robotic commenting.
